https://github.com/VCWVL/wede5020-poe-st10488677
Overview
This project is a PlayStation-themed interactive website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It features multiple functional pages, modern animations, and a responsive layout inspired by the official PlayStation design aesthetic.
The website simulates a mini e-commerce experience where users can browse PlayStation products, add items to their cart, make enquiries, and contact the brand — all within a clean, blue-themed interface.
